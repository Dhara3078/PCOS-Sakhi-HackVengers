# What is PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome)? 
> "One in five(20%) Indian women suffers from PCOS" ~ The Hindu.
* PCOS stands for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, a hormonal disorder that affects women of reproductive age.
* Women with PCOS have small cysts or follicles on their ovaries, which can lead to hormonal imbalances and excess male hormones.
* Symptoms of PCOS can include irregular periods or no periods at all, excessive hair growth on the face, chest, or abdomen, acne, and weight gain.
* PCOS is caused by an excess of male hormones, known as androgens, in the body. **Insulin** resistance can also play a role in its development.
> PCOS is the leading cause of infertility in women.
* In India, the incidence of PCOS is higher among urban women than rural women.
* Liestyle changes, such as a healthy diet and regular exercise, can help manage PCOS symptoms.
> while there is no cure for PCOS, early diagnosis and management can improve quality of life and prevent long-term health complications such as diabetes and heart disease.

# Our Solution - PCOS-Sakhi 
* PCOS-Sakhi consists of mainly 3 sections:
  1. PCOS-Detection:
  2. Moodie:
  3. Foodie:

## PCOS-detection:
| Model | Accuracy | 
| --- | --- |
| Logistic Regression | |
| Decision Tree | | 
| Support Vector Machine | | 
| Random Forest Classifier | | 

* Performed Exploratory Data Analysis and here's the glimpse:
* 
* This model uses Random Forest Classifier to classify whether the person has high chances of PCOS and should reach out to a doctor
* We collected our own data via Google form for these below mentioned features but the data is currently inadequate to train.
* We are using following features:`['PCOS (Y/N)', ' Age (yrs)', 'Pregnant(Y/N)', 'No of aborptions',
       'Bloated', 'facial hair', 'chest hair', 'difficult to loose weight',
       'mood swings', 'anxiety/depression/stress', 'Irregular_sleep',
       'Weight gain(Y/N)', 'hair growth(Y/N)', 'Skin darkening (Y/N)',
       'Hair loss(Y/N)', 'Pimples(Y/N)', 'Fast food (Y/N)',
       'Reg Exercise(Y/N)', 'Weight (Kg)', 'Height(Cm) ', 'BMI', 'Blood Group',
       'Pulse rate(bpm) ', 'Cycle(months)', 'Cycle length(days)',
       'Marriage Status (Yrs)', 'Hip(inch)', 'Waist(inch)', 'Waist/Hip Ratio']`
